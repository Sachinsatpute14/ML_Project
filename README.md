# ML_Project
This project automatically predicts ticket severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) using error screenshots and text through a multimodal ML model. Developed a DL-based Customer Support Ticket Classifier using CNN + LSTM fusion to extract insights from text and screenshots, outputting urgency, confidence score, and recommended priority actions.
